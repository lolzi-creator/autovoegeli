    "story_p1": "The history of Auto Voegeli AG dates back to 1973, when the current location in Grenchen was founded under the name Auto Walser. In 1992, it was taken over by Fredy Voegeli, who successfully continued the garage as an official representative of Ford and Honda and sustainably shaped the location in Grenchen.",
    "story_p2": "In 2019, the traditional garage was taken over by Dejan Kostadinov. With over 25 years of industry experience – including the successful establishment of Pneu Express GmbH in Solothurn – he brings new impulses and an expanded business concept. Today, Auto Voegeli AG presents itself as a modern, independent workshop in the Garage Plus network, ensuring professional care for vehicles of all brands. In addition to our wide range of used vehicles, we have strategically expanded our portfolio to include motorcycles from leading brands (Zontes, Voge, Wottan-Taro, Ariic, SWM, KOVE, LONCIN, XEV YOYO) as well as electric vehicles. With this interplay of tradition, experience and innovative spirit, we work daily for the satisfaction of our customers. Our location in Grenchen offers not only automotive expertise, but also personal consultation and partnership service – as it has always been our philosophy.",
